          <!--<h4 class="mb-0">ICS Augmentation tool – Master’s Research</h4>
          <p>To support first responders to make quality decisions during disaster response with a minium cognitive workload</p>
<p><b>Look for UX skills including research experiment design, user interviews, observation, contextual inquiry, writing design recommendations, usability testing</b></p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Research Plan</h4>
<p>My research questions were: <ul><li>Can a context based decision support system enhance human decision making?</li>
  <li>Can a tablet-based interactive interface display the on-scene information to improve the response time while making decisions?</li>
  </ul>
  I planned to use interviews and observation techniques to understand the user behavior on disaster scene and to identify the key functionalities to show on user interface that will allow them to do their job easier.
</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Process</h4>

<h4 class="mb-0">User Interviews</h4>
<p>After the approval of my IRB, I recruited 20+ first responders from Fairborn Fire Department through emails. I designed two disaster scenarios involving chemical hazard and vehicular accident, framed questions based on those scenarios and recorded the user response.</p>
<p>A few sample questions from the script include:
  <ul><li>Upon arrival, what are the immediate priorities of the Incident Commander (IC)?
</li>
    <li>Who will the IC notify at this phase of the incident?
</li>
<li>Where should the Incident Command Post (ICP) be located?
</li>
<li>What information is important in order to take those initial actions?</li>
<li>From where would the IC obtain the information he/she would need at this phase of the incident?
</li>

  </ul></p>

<p>  Some sample responses include:
<b>Immediate priorities of the Incident Commander</b></p>
<p>Immediate priorities would be to take measures to ensure the life safety of the people involved in the incident and the environmental safety.</p>
<p><b>Chiefs involved on scene</b></p>
<p>At this point of time, alarms will be used as a form of communication to ask for resources required to manage the incident. Additional notifications will be sent via Dispatcher to Operation Section officer, Law enforcement officer (to ensure safety of the parameter), Hazmat for (chemical identification, Department of transportation (to clear the traffic and isolate the incident area) for an effective incident management.</p>
<p><b>Information that an IC needs to know</b></p>
<p>Important information that an IC needs to know at this instant are aerial view of the incident, number of vehicles involved in the accident, if there is a trace of any chemical in the incident, victims of the incident, if any responders been exposed to the Hazmat.</p>

    <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/evaluation.png" style="height:190px" alt="">
</p>

<p>Based on interview response I created a High-Fi prototype on AxureRP and conducted usability evaluation with experts</p>

  <img class="img-fluid col-md-3 img-thumbnail" src="img/pro2.png" alt="">
    <img class="img-fluid col-md-3 img-thumbnail" src="img/pro3.png"  alt="">
</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">User Observation</h4>
<p>Implemented the simulated hazard scenarios in a training environment to observe and understand the user behavior during response planning and to evaluate the usefulness of the prototype
</p>
<p>
  <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill1.png" alt="">

<img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill3.png" alt="">
<img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After the drill was over, the responders were asked fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the use of prototype during time-critical disaster scenarios</p>
<p>Some of the questions included:</p>
<p><ul><li>Please rate your experience working with system</li>
<li>Are there any features in the prototype that are least important or completely removed?</li>
<li>How supportive are the information in the prototype in making decisions?</li>
<li>Which form factor that you believe will be more appropriate on scene?</li></ul></p>

<p>From the responses, I identified the usability issues and developed a functional application on android addressing those issues</p>
<p><b>Usability issues:</b></p>
<p><ul><li>Presenting multiple information in one screen was overwhelming</li>
  <li>Response time and more number of interactions</li>
  <li>Use of large form factor tablet</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Overcoming the issues:</b></p>
<p>I planned to use smaller size tablet which would be easy to carry and use it on disaster scene. Minimized the user interaction with by providing necessary information in one click. Augment the system by incorporating AI methodolies to provide context-based information at right time without being requested by the user. Context-based knowledge was given to the system using Ontology.</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">System development and Experiment Design</h4>
<p>Built Decision Support System (DSS) as a mobile application and determined the usability aspects with a heuristic evaluation.</p>

      <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/experimentalsetup.png" alt="">
  </p>

  <p>Analyzed the quantitative data utilizing JMP and constructed reports to show the significant difference in user response quality with and without the use of DSS.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-0">What I learned</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Interative interviews with subject matter experts helped identify the problem areas and the product goal</li>
<li>Prototyping helped visualize the design recommendations without spending significant amount of time on coding</li>
<li>A refined product goal and research questions helped in experiment design</li>
<li>Usability testing on a prototype can also lead to some useful results</li>
<li>A simple timer can simulate the time critical nature of a disaster incident even if it's not perfect</li>
</ul></p>-->


          <h4 class="mb-0">MIND BOGGLERS - GAME PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT</h4>

         <p class="mb-0">To propose and develop a new board game prototype that will attract the customers and satisfies their needs including cost, effort in understanding rules, competitive aspects, fun/entertainment etc.
</p>

<p><b>Look for UX skills including surveying, prototyping, and competitive analysis</b></p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Customer Requirements</h4>
<p>Voice of Customer:<ul><li>Constructed a series of questions that I thought could best provide insight into potential needs. I tallied customer statements and converted them into needs.
</li>
  <li>From there, I identified competing board games and sought to establish a benchmark with them. Ranked my game prototype with respect to them, and created product specifications.

</li>
<li>Beginning first with identifying users, I struggled slightly at whom to ask. While the campus provides
an ample population from which to select, it was unclear if I should identify lead users by random selection.
To remedy this, I planned to ask the club members of the Adventurer’s Guild, an on-campus board gaming club.
 These users would probably be the most to benefit from the creation of a new game, and offered excellent feedback.
 My established users are the board gaming community, those with families and children, along with casual gamers.
 I identified most likely to contain lead users and surveyed the group.</li>
 <li> To ensure enough quantity, I also set up an online questionnaire. The survey, conducted through Survey Monkey, would allow to receive multiple evaluations with different community</li>
<li>Both the on-line and in person, questions revealed certain characteristics about the users.
   </li>
  </ul>

</p>

<h4 class="mb-0">Ranking Competitors</h4>
<p>Next, I performed a competitive market analysis to better determine the value to the customer target. First, I determined five games that I believe it compete with my product and they have large market share. The five games are, Carrom, Chess, Marbles, Billiards and Air hockey.
</p>
<p>The competitors are assigned weightage (1 worst and best). The results of this analysis are shown below</p>

  <figcaption style="text-align:center">Fig.3 Customer need statements and benchmarking information</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<h4 class="mb-0">Technical Requirements</h4>
<p>Product Design</p>
<p>After assessing the customer requirements and formulating them into technical specifications, I conceptualized the overall design of the game. According to the mission statement, the central idea was to combine a game like Carrom with Block Breaker.
</p>
<p>The board will be rectangular in shape, with each side designated as the player’s area. In the area will be a painted circular region in which the game pieces will be assembled. The game pieces can be assembled at random, or at the will of the player. The objective of the game will be to flick a game piece, called the Striker, at the opposing players game pieces in an effort to knock them out of the painted circle. If a piece is knocked out, it is removed from play. Players take turns flicking and knocking down game pieces until the one of them has no more pieces left. The player with the last piece standing wins. Adding to the challenge of the game, there are two walls in place in the middle of the game board for each player to work around. The walls feature two medium-sized openings on either side of the board, with a smaller-sized opening in the middle. </p>



<h4 class="mb-0">Concept Screening Matrix</h4>
<p>In order to assess each concept, a concept-screening matrix was used. The selection criteria were based off of both perceived needs from customer statements, as well as what I thought was important in the function of the concept. </p>

<li>Information extraction from the existing documents using NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Storage of this information in an ontology with axioms (logical rules) to provide domain knowledge for common scenarios (for example, a fire may require certain responses, which would be inappropriate for another type of disaster, like a flood).</li>
<li>From this information, we can create new training scenarios and evaluate how well new employees respond based on strengths and weaknesses extracted from previous scenarios as described in the AARs.</li>

<!--<h4 class="mb-0">Android Application for Tinnitus Management</h4>
<p class="mb-0">Tinnitus is regarded as the phantom awareness of sound which includes a variety of perceived noises, but not limited to: ringing, buzzing, and in some cases hissing. Ongoing studies using functional neuroimaging also help us identify the regions in the brain that might be responsible for Tinnitus. Although there is no current cure for Tinnitus, there are multiple self-management techniques to help reduce the effects of the disorder. Downloadable applications on smart devices have become a popular tool in managing the effects of Tinnitus. In some cases, these applications incorporated with mindfulness techniques and sound therapy, have become an absolute necessity, and have improved the quality of life of individuals affected by Tinnitus. The purpose of this research is to develop an Android-based application specifically for Tinnitus patients. This application aims to use mindfulness techniques to provide self-coping strategies to Tinnitus patients and measure the effectiveness of those strategies.</p>
