          <h2 class="mb-5">Research Projects</h2>
          <h4 class="mb-0">ICS Augmentation tool – Master’s thesis Project</h4>
          <p>To support first responders to make quality decisions during disaster response with a minium cognitive workload</p>
<p><b>Look for UX skills including research experiment design, user interviews, observation, contextual inquiry, writing design recommendations, usability testing</b></p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Research Plan</h4>
<p>My research questions were: <ul><li>Can a context based decision support system enhance human decision making?</li>
  <li>Can a tablet-based interactive interface display the on-scene information to improve the response time while making decisions?</li>
  </ul>
  I planned to use interviews and observation techniques to understand the user behavior on disaster scene and to identify the key functionalities to show on user interface that will allow them to do their job easier.
</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Process</h4>

<h4 class="mb-0">User Interviews</h4>
<p>After the approval of my IRB, I recruited 20+ first responders from Fairborn Fire Department through emails. I designed two disaster scenarios involving chemical hazard and vehicular accident, framed questions based on those scenarios and recorded the user response.</p>
<p>A few sample questions from the script include:
  <ul><li>Upon arrival, what are the immediate priorities of the Incident Commander (IC)?
</li>
    <li>Who will the IC notify at this phase of the incident?
</li>
<li>Where should the Incident Command Post (ICP) be located?
</li>
<li>What information is important in order to take those initial actions?</li>
<li>From where would the IC obtain the information he/she would need at this phase of the incident?
</li>

  </ul>

  Some sample responses include:
<p><b>Immediate priorities of the Incident Commander</b><p>
<p>Immediate priorities would be to take measures to ensure the life safety of the people involved in the incident and the environmental safety.</p>
<p><b>Chiefs involved on scene</b></p>
<p>At this point of time, alarms will be used as a form of communication to ask for resources required to manage the incident. Additional notifications will be sent via Dispatcher to Operation Section officer, Law enforcement officer (to ensure safety of the parameter), Hazmat for (chemical identification, Department of transportation (to clear the traffic and isolate the incident area) for an effective incident management.</p>
<p><b>Information that an IC needs to know</b></p>
<p>Important information that an IC needs to know at this instant are aerial view of the incident, number of vehicles involved in the accident, if there is a trace of any chemical in the incident, victims of the incident, if any responders been exposed to the Hazmat.</p>

</p>

    <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill.png"  alt="">
    <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/evaluation.png" style="height:190px" alt="">
</p>

<p>Based on interview response I created a High-Fi prototype on AxureRP and conducted usability evaluation with experts</p>
<p><img class="img-fluid col-md-3 img-thumbnail" src="img/pro1.png" alt="">
  <img class="img-fluid col-md-3 img-thumbnail" src="img/pro2.png" alt="">
    <img class="img-fluid col-md-3 img-thumbnail" src="img/pro3.png"  alt="">
</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">User Observation</h4>
<p>Implemented the simulated hazard scenarios in a training environment to observe and understand the user behavior during response planning and to evaluate the usefulness of the prototype
</p>
<p>
  <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill1.png" alt="">
<img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill2.png" alt="">
<img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill3.png" alt="">
<img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/drill4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After the drill was over, the responders were asked fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the use of prototype during time-critical disaster scenarios</p>
<p>Some of the questions included:</p>
<p><ul><li>Please rate your experience working with system</li>
<li>Are there any features in the prototype that are least important or completely removed?</li>
<li>How supportive are the information in the prototype in making decisions?</li>
<li>Which form factor that you believe will be more appropriate on scene?</li></ul></p>

<p>From the responses, I identified the usability issues and developed a functional application on android addressing those issues</p>
<p><b>Usability issues:</b></p>
<p><ul><li>Presenting multiple information in one screen was overwhelming</li>
  <li>Response time and more number of interactions</li>
  <li>Use of large form factor tablet</li></ul></p>

<p><b>Overcoming the issues:</b></p>
<p>I planned to use smaller size tablet which would be easy to carry and use it on disaster scene. Minimized the user interaction with by providing necessary information in one click. Augment the system by incorporating AI methodolies to provide context-based information at right time without being requested by the user. Context-based knowledge was given to the system using Ontology.</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">System development and Experiment Design</h4>
<p>Built Decision Support System (DSS) as a mobile application and determined the usability aspects with a heuristic evaluation.

  <p><img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/result_full.png" alt="">
    <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/experimentalsetup3.png" alt="">
      <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/experimentalsetup2.png"  alt="">
      <img class="img-fluid col-md-4 img-thumbnail" src="img/experimentalsetup.png" alt="">
  </p>

  <p>Analyzed the quantitative data utilizing JMP and constructed reports to show the significant difference in user response quality with and without the use of DSS.
</p>

<h4 class="mb-0">What I learned</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Interative interviews with subject matter experts helped identify the problem areas and the product goal</li>
<li>Prototyping helped visualize the design recommendations without spending significant amount of time on coding</li>
<li>A refined product goal and research questions helped in experiment design</li>
<li>Usability testing on a prototype can also lead to some useful results</li>
<li>A simple timer can simulate the time critical nature of a disaster incident even if it's not perfect</li>
</ul></p>


          <h4 class="mb-0">Case Based Reasoning System for First Responders – PhD Thesis (In progress)</h4>
          <p class="mb-0">One of the most valuable resources of any organization is the implicit knowledge of its employees and the lessons they have learned by working there over time. As these employees retire or go to other organizations, that knowledge is lost. Our project is focused on emergency response domain and one way to capture that knowledge in this domain is to extract information from lessons learned documents or After Action Reports (AARs). However, those documents often sit on a file server unlooked at after they were created. My end goal is to build an adaptive learning system to train new personnel using the knowledge gained by retired responders by harvesting the knowledge in these reports, as encapsulated in the AARs. To do this, we will have three parts:

</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Information extraction from the existing documents using NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Storage of this information in an ontology with axioms (logical rules) to provide domain knowledge for common scenarios (for example, a fire may require certain responses, which would be inappropriate for another type of disaster, like a flood).</li>
<li>From this information, we can create new training scenarios and evaluate how well new employees respond based on strengths and weaknesses extracted from previous scenarios as described in the AARs.</li>
</ul></p>




<!--<h4 class="mb-0">Android Application for Tinnitus Management</h4>
<p class="mb-0">Tinnitus is regarded as the phantom awareness of sound which includes a variety of perceived noises, but not limited to: ringing, buzzing, and in some cases hissing. Ongoing studies using functional neuroimaging also help us identify the regions in the brain that might be responsible for Tinnitus. Although there is no current cure for Tinnitus, there are multiple self-management techniques to help reduce the effects of the disorder. Downloadable applications on smart devices have become a popular tool in managing the effects of Tinnitus. In some cases, these applications incorporated with mindfulness techniques and sound therapy, have become an absolute necessity, and have improved the quality of life of individuals affected by Tinnitus. The purpose of this research is to develop an Android-based application specifically for Tinnitus patients. This application aims to use mindfulness techniques to provide self-coping strategies to Tinnitus patients and measure the effectiveness of those strategies.</p>
<h4 class="mb-0">Android Application for RPA Pilots</h4>
<p class="mb-0">Developing an Android based application to be used as an adaptive learning tool that provides feedback to RPA pilots during simulated flight scenarios. Several form factors are being examined including wearable devices.</p>-->
